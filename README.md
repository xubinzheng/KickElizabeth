small ios game


There a problem I hope you can help me to solve it.
I want to add a timer in GameScene.swift. If anyone touches the screen, then gameStarted = true, at the same time NSTimer works.
If maskCode == MASK_EDGE|MAK_BALL, game is over, at the same time timer stoped.
Then in the GameOverScene.swift, it will push out the time.

Really thank you for your time
